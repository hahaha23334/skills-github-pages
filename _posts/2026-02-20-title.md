Today, I took a step back to really review how to use GitHub. Even though I’ve used it for years to submit homework and collaborate on school projects, I’ve always felt like a bit of an outsider looking in.

Starting this blog is my way of changing that. It's an opportunity to finally make full use of this platform and document my coding journey. I’ve been writing code for six years across Python, Java, C#, and C++, but I’m ready to push past the basics and truly become an expert.

I know the beginning is always the hardest part. There's a lot of talk right now about how AI can just do all the heavy lifting for us, but my goal is to become a genuinely great developer in my own right. I’m not entirely sure what this path will look like, but I'm ready to embrace the challenge. Welcome to my journey.
